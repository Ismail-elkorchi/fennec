# Security Policy

We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

How to report:
- Preferred: Open a private security advisory on GitHub for this repository.
- If that is not possible, open a minimal public issue and request a private channel.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.
